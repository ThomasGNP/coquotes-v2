# Coquotes
Coquotes is a simple web page aimed to collect funny (or stupid) quotes told by my friends.

The idea for this project came after spending four years with my friend Corentin aka Coco, who is the best source for stupid quotes.

Demo: http://quotes.opiumozor.com

This is the second version of this mini-project, you can find the first one here: [coquotes](https://github.com/opiumozor/coquotes).
This one is written in Python & Flask.

## Usage

`/admin` to add a new quote.

## Requirements

 * Python 2.7
 * Flask
 * Funny friends

## TODO

* update quotes
* delete quotes
* save the quote_list in the cloud (dropbox integration)
